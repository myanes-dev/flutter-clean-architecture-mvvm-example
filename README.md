![Alt text](docs/architecture.png)
## Presentation <-> Domain <-> Data
- Presentation: Screens/Views + ViewModels
- Domain: Models + UseCases
- Data: DTOs + DB_Entities +Repositories + DataSources

## Tech Specifications
- DI
- MVVM: UI State and Events
- Use cases
- Repository pattern
- Networking: Http + Json decode
- Theme: Light & Dark (from system settings)
- Basic Error Handling
- Testing: Widgets + Unit tests

> **Comming soon**:
> - Translated Strings -> i18n
> - Offline mode (Access to results history from local Data source)
> - More robust error handling
> - More complex state management examples with [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
> - Custom App Icon + Splash screen

## Libraries 📦
- Dendency Injection with [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)
- State Management with [getX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) & [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- Tesiting with [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito)
- Neteworking with [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)

## App Features 📋

- **Play Screen**. Two rouds where you can guess the breed of a random dog by looking at it's picture.
Data comes from Dog CEO: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- **Results Scren**. It shows correct answers count and a replay button.
- **Results history** saved in memory (data is lost when app is closed)

> **Comming soon**:
> - **Results history** saved locally


## Testing ⚙️

Both **Unit and Widget tests** examples are available. For Unit testing dependencies are replaced by mock classes generated by [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito).

### Verifications:
- A game is created with 2 rounds
- Loading indicator it's shown and hided
- Move to next round
- Show game results
 
Some examples:

```
- PlayViewModel - Unit testing
- GameCreatorUsecase - Unit testing
- GameResultScreen - Widget testing
```
